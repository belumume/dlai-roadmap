Before ending this session, check if you made progress on the DLAI Roadmap project:

1. **Did you complete any items from the plan?**
   - If yes, offer to update CLAUDE.md to mark them as completed
   - Reference: `~/.claude/plans/delegated-imagining-unicorn.md`

2. **Did you discover new issues or tasks?**
   - If yes, offer to add them to the NOT COMPLETED section of CLAUDE.md

3. **Quick checklist:**
   - [ ] CLAUDE.md reflects current state
   - [ ] Any new commits pushed to GitHub
   - [ ] Tests still passing (if code changed)

If no significant work was done, skip this reminder.
