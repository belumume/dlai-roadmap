Remove vestigial ''specialization'' category from all courses\n   - Was a format descriptor masquerading as topic category\n   - Type field already handles format (certificate/course/short)\n\n2. Make Q8 course counts dynamic (was hardcoded, 7/8 were wrong)\n   - Counts now calculated from actual course data\n   - Will auto-update when courses change\n\n3. Implement quality-based elective sorting (was array order)\n   - Score = partner tier + type weight + depth (hours)\n   - DLAI core courses prioritized, then major partners\n   - Certificates weighted higher than short courses\n   - Ensures best courses surface as electives, not arbitrary order\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
